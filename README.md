# IPWK6-CORE
You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish this: A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).You have two possible approaches (as  shown below) given the datasets that will be provided

*****************
Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)

### Approach 1: Polynomial approach

What to train given:
Rank of home team
Rank of away team
Tournament type
Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.
Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

### Approach 2: Logistic approach

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)


# In order to work on the above problem, you need to do the following:

Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question
Expected flow for the assessment:
Perform your EDA
Perform any necessary feature engineering 
Check of multicollinearity
Start building the model
Cross-validate the model
Compute RMSE
Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlett’s test
Perform appropriate regressions on the data including your justification
Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements.
